# BigDataBowl

Sky Vision evaluates every targeted rep between a Receiver and Defensive Back by quantifying five technical pillars that explain who truly won the play relative to the ball.
Each category isolates a measurable skill that affects the ball’s outcome.
Improv Index runs parallel to capture creative adaptation.

We will use the 5 following pillars:    

**A** = Anticipation/Reaction
**S** = Separation/Space
**E** = Execution/Technique
**E** (yes) = Ball Tracking
**I** (nnovation) = Creativity

Sky Vision combines these pillars into an **AFTERSNAP IQ™** metric. Our vision will curate a 1–10 per-play score scaled to a 0–100 overall grade for comparison across positions, archetypes, and coverage situations.
