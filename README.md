## Sky Vision: AFTERSNAP IQ™

Sky Vision evaluates every targeted rep between a wide receiver (WR) and a defensive back (DB) by quantifying five technical pillars that reveal **who truly won the play relative to the ball**.  
Each pillar isolates a measurable skill that influences the ball’s outcome, while the additional **Improv Index** runs parallel to capture creative adaptation beyond the scripted route.
## Evaluation Pillars
- **A = Anticipation / Reaction** — quickness of response after the snap  
- **S = Separation / Space** — distance created or denied at the catch point  
- **E = Execution / Technique** — precision, body control, and mechanics  
- **E = (Eye) Ball Tracking** — ability to locate, track, and adjust to the ball  
- **I = Innovation / Creativity** — off-script adaptability under pressure  
## Methodology
Sky Vision uses **NFL Next Gen Stats tracking data** combined with annotated video to compute the pillar metrics.  
Each pillar is scored on a **1–10 scale**, weighted by positional importance, and aggregated into an **AFTERSNAP IQ™** metric.  
The result is a per-play score scaled to a **0–100 overall grade** for comparison across positions, archetypes, and coverage situations.

Scores will be validated against other analystical sources and visualized through the **Sky Vision dashboard** for scouting and player-development insights.
