# BigDataBowl - Sky Vision

Sky Vision evaluates every targeted rep between a wide receiver (WR) and a defensive back (DB) by quantifying five technical pillars that reveal who truly won the play relative to the ball.

Each pillar isolates a measurable skill that influences the outcome, while the additional **Improv Index** runs parallel to capture creative adaptation beyond scripted routes.

We will use the following five pillars:
- **A** = Anticipation / Reaction ‚Äî quickness of response after the snap
- **S** = Separation / Space ‚Äî distance created or denied at the catch point
- **E** = Execution / Technique ‚Äî precision, body control, and mechanics
- **E** = (Eye) Ball Tracking ‚Äî ability to locate, track, and adjust to the ball
- **I** = Innovation / Creativity ‚Äî off-script adaptability under pressure

Sky Vision will use **NFL Next Gen Stats tracking data** combined with **annotated video** to compute the pillar metrics.
Each pillar will be scored on a **1‚Äì10 scale**, weighted by positional importance, and aggregated into an **AFTERSNAP IQ‚Ñ¢** metric.

The result will be a per-play score scaled to a **0‚Äì100 overall grade**, enabling comparison across positions, archetypes, and coverage situations.
Scores will be validated against other analytical sources and visualized through the Sky Vision dashboard to support scouting and player-development insights.
