Sky Vision evaluates every targeted rep between a Receiver and Defensive Back by quantifying five technical pillars that explain who truly won the play relative to the ball.
Each category isolates a measurable skill that affects the ballâ€™s outcome.
Improv Index runs parallel to capture creative adaptation.

We will use the 5 following categories:     
**A** = Anticipation/Reaction
**S** = Separation/Space
**E** = Execution/Technique
**E** (yes) = Ball Tracking
**I** (nnovation) = Creativity
