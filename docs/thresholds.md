Quick reference for how each pillar's raw measurements map to 1–10 scores.

Pillar Thresholds:
- Anticipation - ms, ≤100-200 (elite), >150 (red flag/ low)
- Execution - yds, ≤1-1.5 (elite), >2 (red flag/ low)
- Separation - yds, ≥1-2 (elite), <0.5 (red flag/ low)
- Innovation - Δyds, ≥0.3–1 (elite), ≤0.1 (red flag/ low)
